Kinect
======

JQuery plugin to make it easier to use zigfu with the Kinect.


This is a plugin that works with the browser plugin Zigfu.

It allows you to make easy callbacks on actions. Documentation is kind of missing right now, I will update more later. 

The example file will will show you a little how it works.
